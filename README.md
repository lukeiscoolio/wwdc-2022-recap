As you can see you can put widgets on your lock screen!

Get too many notifications? Now Apple made a very new organised bar with all your notifications at the bottom of the lock screen!

#### Different Lock Screens Depending on Your Focus

Depending on your different focuses your lock screen can change! Say I had no focus on, it would be my default lock screen but say I had the focus "Work" for example, I would make it so when I turn on the Work focus it changes my lock screen to the lock screen fitting in the focus!

#### Editing Your Lock Screen
Want to edit your lock screen? Just simply touch and hold your lock screen, then swipe. *i think*. Some developers might have put the WidgetKit API in their app, this means that you put widgets on your home screen! For example, you can put the uber widget on your lock screen to track your uber!
